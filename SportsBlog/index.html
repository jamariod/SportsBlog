            The XFL gave Colin Kaepernick an opportunity to join the
            reincarnation of Vince McMahon's league. At the end of the day,
            Kaepernick's salary requirements were too high for the league to
            give him a commitment. XFL commissioner Oliver Luck explained to
            National Public Radio why Kaepernick wasn't playing in the league on
            its opening weekend, as the league wanted him to star in the reboot
            of XFL 2.0. "We gave it some thought," Luck said to NPR, via NBC
            Sports Bay Area. "We have some pretty significant salary
            restrictions, you know. We're a start-up league, so we want to make
            sure that we can be fiscally responsible and fiscally prudent. And
            the, you know, salary requirements that some folks, you know, shared
            with us were in our case exorbitant, so we, you know, couldn't go
            down that path."

          <h2>The Winners and Losers of the XFL’s Debut Weekend</h2>
          <p>
            This weekend was the first after the Super Bowl, and therefore the first of 2020 without any NFL games. Normal people, previously fettered by the chains of football fandom, probably had a lovely time doing all the things they may have skipped during the playoffs: taking their dogs to the park, or scheduling brunch with friends, or going ice skating with a loved one. The true weirdos, though, hunkered down in front of our televisions, our skin crawling after five whole days without exposure to professional football. It was time to watch the XFL.

          <h3>XFL Players of the Week Awards – XFL Week 1</h3>
          <p>
            It’s been an exciting weekend of football, and we’ve seen some great play out of the XFL’s talented pool. The XFL News Hub staff has voted, and these three players are now forever enshrined as the inaugural class of XNH’s Players of the Week.

          <h3>XFL Opening Weekend Final TV Ratings And Attendance</h3>
          <p>
            The opening weekend of the revamped XFL is now history, and the final ratings for the four games are in.
            As previously reported, the first game airing on ABC on Saturday featuring the D.C. Defenders defeating the Seattle Dragons averaged 3.3 million viewers and scored a 2.07 rating. The attendance for the game was 17,163 fans.
            FOX aired the second game on Saturday between L.A. Wildcats and the Houston Roughnecks, which averaged 3.29 million viewers and a 1.91 rating and drew 17,815 fans.

            NBA All-Star Weekend is Feb. 14-16 in Chicago, and this is the third consecutive year in which captains participated in a fantasy draft and selected their own teams, compared to the traditional East vs. West format.
            All-Star captains LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo have made their draft picks. All-Star Saturday night participants have been unveiled. Rising Stars and Celebrity Game rosters are set.

            Major League Baseball is mulling significant changes to its postseason, including increasing the number of teams from 10 to 14 and adding a reality TV-type format to determine which teams play each other in an expanded wild-card round, sources told ESPN.
            MLB is considering a move in which each league would have three division winners and four wild-card teams making the postseason starting in 2022, sources said. The best team in the league would receive a bye into the division series. The two remaining division winners and the wild-card team with the best record of the four would each host all games of a best-of-three series in the opening round.
